## Overview

`dog-watcher` is a TUI (textual user interace) for [managing processes in Stardog](https://docs.stardog.com/operating-stardog/server-administration/process-management).

At the time of writing this, the primary means of managing processes in the Stardog server is through the use of the `stardog-admin ps <list/kill/status>` [CLI commands](https://docs.stardog.com/stardog-admin-cli-reference/ps/). My main motivation in creating `dog-watcher` was to simplify the process of monitoring running processes in the Stardog server. Additionally, it allows for easy termination of processes and adjusting how often it refreshes the processes in its view.

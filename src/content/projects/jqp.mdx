`jqp` is a TUI (textual user interace) for crafting [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) queries.

## Overview

My main goal in making `jqp` was to help myself and others learn `jq` syntax a bit better. I found that I often iterate on my `jq` queries prior to adding it to my scripts.

The `jqp` UI is broken up into 3 main components.

1. an input to enter your `jq` query
2. a scrollable viewport to view your input
3. a scrollable viewport to view your query's output

`jqp` can read input via the `-f/--file` flag or via stdin which can be useful for exploring JSON API responses.

```bash
jqp --file data.json
```

```bash
curl "https://dummyjson.com/products" | jqp
```

Keybindings are provided to both copy the query to your system clipboard and save the current query's output to a file.

## Example Workflows

`jqp` has been featured on Youtube on some developer-centric channels.

## Themes

`jqp` has over [**40** themes](https://github.com/noahgorstein/jqp#themes) to pick from with options for both terminals with a light and dark background color.

Below are 2 of my personal favorite light and dark themes - `monokai-light` and `github-dark`.

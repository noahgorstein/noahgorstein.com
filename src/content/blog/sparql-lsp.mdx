These days, my editor of choice is [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). While I'm not frequently writing SPARQL queries at work like I used to, I found myself recently wondering if there was a documented SPARQL [LSP server configuration](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md) to use with Neovim's native LSP client. There was not, so I attempted to leverage [Stardog's SPARQL language server](https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog-language-servers) to do just the thing and it worked pretty well!

## Setup

Below are the steps I followed to set this up. This guide assumes you are using [Neovim's native LSP client](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html) and have familiarity with the general setup for configuring the LSP client for different language servers.

### 1. Install Stardog's SPARQL language server

```bash
npm install -g sparql-language-server
```

### 2.Configure your package manager to use your `nvim-lspconfig` checkout

I installed the [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) plugin with my package manager, [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), and so I configured lazy.nvim to use my local checkout of nvim-lspconfig in my `init.lua` like so:

```lua title="init.lua"
require("lazy").setup("plugins", {
  dev = {
    -- directory where you store your local plugin projects
    path = "~/projects",
	-- @type string[] plugins that match these patterns will use your local versions instead of being fetched from GitHub
    patterns = {"nvim-lspconfig"}
  },
})
```

### 3. Create the SPARQL LSP Server Configuration

In your nvim-lspconfig checkout, create a new file at `lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/sparql.lua`:

    ```bash
    touch lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/sparql.lua
    ```

Now define the SPARQL server configuration:

    ```lua title="sparql.lua"
    local util = require 'lspconfig.util'

    local bin_name = 'sparql-language-server'
    local cmd = { 'node', bin_name, '--stdio' }

    return {
    	default_config = {
    		cmd = cmd,
    		filetypes = { 'sparql', 'rq' },
    		root_dir = util.find_git_ancestor or vim.fn.getcwd(),
    		single_file_support = true
    	}
    }
    ```

    This tells the Neovim LSP client to attempt to use the SPARQL language server if the file has an extension of `sparql` or `rq`.

### 4. Modify your Neovim config

Add the language server setup to your `init.lua`, substituting your path to the executable `sparql-language-server` installed via `npm`.

    ```lua title="init.lua"
    require("lspconfig").sparql.setup {
      cmd = { "node", os.getenv("NVM_BIN") .. "/sparql-language-server", "--stdio" },
      capabilities=capabilities,
      on_attach = on_attach
    }
    ```

    For my `cmd`, since I use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) as my Node version manager, I have access to the `NVM_BIN` environment variable which as the variable name suggests, is just `nvm`'s installation directory.

## Treesitter Syntax Highlighting (Optional)

Optionally install the [SPARQL treesitter parser](https://github.com/BonaBeavis/tree-sitter-sparql) for Neovim to get syntax highlighting. In any buffer in normal mode enter `:TSInstall sparql`.

## Demo

Open an existing or new file with an `rq` or `sparql` extension and begin writing some SPARQL.

## A Final Word

That's it! I hope you've found this helpful. If you are in the semantics world, Stardog has a few other very useful language servers for SHACL, TRiG, and Turtle. If you're a Stardog user, there's also language servers for SMS (Stardog Mapping Syntax), SRS (Stardog Rules Syntax), and Stardog's GraphQL extensions. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog-language-servers) on Github. The process should be roughly the same for integrating these.

Welcome to my little journey of visualizing profiled SPARQL query plans using Python and [Textualize](https://www.textualize.io/)! In this blog post, I'll walk you through my experience building a [text-based user interface (TUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) to bring profiled SPARQL query plans from [Stardog](https://docs.stardog.com/) to life. But before we dive into the details, let me give you a sneak peek of the final product:

## The Challenge of Reading Profiled SPARQL Query Plans in Stardog

I have been working at Stardog now for almost 4 years and while I don't work on the platform's internals (e.g. the query engine), I have had to interact with query plans numerous times - usually while trying to optimize my poorly written SPARQL queries 😊. Stardog has always been able to produce and surface SPARQL query plans to users and semi-recently added a capability to add profiling information to the query plan to help users reduce and eliminate bottlenecks in their queries. This capability is exposed as part of Stardog's query plan service, and like many other features, is exposed via an [HTTP endpoint](https://stardog-union.github.io/http-docs/#tag/SPARQL/operation/explainQueryPost), the [Stardog's CLI](https://docs.stardog.com/stardog-cli-reference/query/query-explain), and [Stardog Studio](https://www.stardog.com/studio/) (an IDE-like experience for interacting with Stardog). This is all good and well, except that the output from the profiler can get pretty verbose and a bit unwieldly to visually inspect.

For example, here's the abbreviated CLI output from a profiled query.

```text title="cli_output.txt"

```

The Stardog CLI and Stardog Studio by will return the profiled query plan in plain text containing information about the profiled plan, the query profiled, and a tree representing the query plan with profiler information about individual nodes, also known as "operators".

<Callout intent="info">

From the [Stardog Docs](https://docs.stardog.com/operating-stardog/database-administration/managing-query-performance#query-plan-syntax):

> The plan is arranged in a hierarchical, tree-like structure which grows left to right. The nodes, called operators, represent units of data processing during evaluation. They correspond to evaluations of graph patterns or solution modifiers as defined in [SPARQL 1.1 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlDefinition). All operators can be regarded as functions which may take some data as input and produce some data as output. All input and output data is represented as streams of [solutions](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlSolutions), that is, sets of bindings of the form `x -> value` where `x` is a variable used in the query and value is some RDF term (IRI, blank node, or literal). Examples of operators include scans, joins, filters, unions, etc.

</Callout>

While the text format is _packed_ with useful information, it is unstructured and hard to parse programmatically. The larger the plan is, the harder these get to visually inspect as well. Wouldn't it be great if we could get the profiled query in some sort of a structured format like JSON so we could potentially make a tool to more easily inspect the plans? Well it turns out the HTTP endpoint can actually return the plan in JSON in addition to plain text!

```json title="Profiler JSON Output"
{
  "prefixes": {...},
  "profiler": {
    "memory": "1.1M",
    "time": "30",

  },
  "dataset": {...},

	  },

}
```

## Introducing Textualize

For the past couple years, I've had a lot of fun building TUIs like [jqp](/projects/jqp) and [guard-dog](/projects/guard-dog).
All of my TUIs to date have been built using Go leveraging [Charmbracelet's bubbletea framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), but I've been using quite a bit of Python at work and was looking for an excuse to leverage it in additional project. I'd heard interesting things about [Textualize](https://www.textualize.io/), which is a Python library for building TUIs and thought I'd give it a shot in my attempt to better visualize profiled Stardog query plans.

### "Rapid Application Development"

Textualize positions itself as a _"Rapid Application Development"_ framework - a point that really resonated with me during the creation of my SPARQL profiler TUI. While there was an initial learning curve grasping Textualize's framework, once I understood the main concepts, the experience was really remarkable. Working within Python and employing [Textual's CSS-like styles](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/CSS/) proved to be a real delight. While I hold deep admiration for bubbletea (and everything the [Charmbracelet](https://charm.sh/) team makes) in my previous TUI endeavors, Textualize not only provides an exceptional developer experience but just being able use Python is a big plus for prototyping (at least for me). This became especially advantageous when dealing with sizable JSON payloads representing profiled SPARQL query plans. While achieving similar results in Go is feasible I'm sure, I found Textualize enabled me to rapidly prototype and implement a functional solution over a weekend of hacking.

## What I Built

I developed a SPARQL Profiler TUI to make it easier to inspect and analyze the SPARQL query plans produced by Stardog. I tried to take _all_ that really useful information returned by Stardog and organize it in more navigable and intuitive way.

<CaptionedImage
  src={profilerTui}
  alt="Screenshot of SPARQL Profiler TUI"
  caption="The TUI offers users a structured and navigable view of the profiled query plan's hierarchy."
/>

See the high-level features of the TUI in the sections below.

### CLI Entrypoint

I quickly constructed a CLI using [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) in order to take input from the user to communicate with their Stardog server and launch the TUI. This is the entrypoint. Below is the usage of the CLI:

```text
❯ sparql-profiler -h
Usage: sparql-profiler [OPTIONS] [QUERY]

  Profiles the QUERY.

  If both the query_file option and QUERY argument are provided, the QUERY
  argument will take precedence.

  If token is provided in addition to a username and password for
  authentication, the token will take precedence.

Options:
  -u, --username TEXT        Stardog username (applicable only if token not
                             provided)  [default: admin]
  -p, --password TEXT        Stardog password (applicable only if token not
                             provided)  [default: admin]
  -t, --token TEXT           Auth JWT token (applicable only if username and
                             password are not provided)
  -e, --endpoint TEXT        Stardog endpoint  [default:
                             http://localhost:5820; required]
  -d, --database TEXT        Stardog database  [required]
  -r, --reasoning            Enables reasoning for the query to be profiled.
  -f, --query_file FILENAME  File containing query to profile
  -h, --help                 Show this message and exit.
```

### Foldable Tree-Like User Interface

The heart of the profiler TUI is an intuitive, foldable tree-like user interface. Leveraging Textualize's powerful [tree widget](https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/tree/), I created a visual representation of the SPARQL query plan. This interface offers users a structured and navigable view of the plan's hierarchy.

The heavy lifting here perse was transforming the JSON output from Stardog containing the profiler information and query plan into my custom tree widget.

```python
class PlanNode:
    def __init__(self, plan_node_dict: dict):
        """Initializes a PlanNode object with the provided dict - the plan nodes/operators returned
        from Stardog as JSON has a structure like this
        """
        self._label = plan_node_dict.get("label")
        self._cardinality = plan_node_dict.get("cardinality")
        self._results = plan_node_dict.get("results")
        self._time_ms = plan_node_dict.get("time", "0")
        self._memory = plan_node_dict.get("memory")
        self._gaps = plan_node_dict.get("gaps", False)
        self._children = [
            PlanNode(plan_node_dict=child_plan_node)
            for child_plan_node in plan_node_dict.get("children", [])
        ]

    ...

class PlanNodeTree(Tree[PlanNode]):
    """Subclassing Textual's Tree widget
    - `PlanNode` is my custom data type to store info about
    nodes/plan operators in a query plan
    """
    def __init__(self, query_plan: dict, namespaces: dict, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.query_plan = query_plan
        self.namespaces = namespaces


def build_tree(tree_node: TreeNode | PlanNodeTree, plan_node: PlanNode):
    """
    Recursively builds a tree structure from a PlanNode object and adds it to the provided tree_node.

    Parameters:
    - tree_node (TreeNode or PlanNodeTree): The current node or tree to which the plan_node will be added.
    - plan_node (PlanNode): The PlanNode object representing a node in a query plan.
    """
    if len(plan_node.children) == 0:
        if isinstance(tree_node, PlanNodeTree):
            tree_node.root.add_leaf(label=plan_node.label, data=plan_node)
        else:
            tree_node.add_leaf(label=plan_node.label, data=plan_node)
        return

    for child_plan_node in plan_node.children:
        if isinstance(tree_node, PlanNodeTree):
            if len(child_plan_node.children) != 0:
                tree_node = tree_node.root.add(
                    label=child_plan_node.label,
                    data=child_plan_node,
                )
                build_tree(tree_node=tree_node, plan_node=child_plan_node)
            else:
                build_tree(tree_node=tree_node, plan_node=child_plan_node)
        else:
            if len(child_plan_node.children) != 0:
                tree = tree_node.add(
                    label=child_plan_node.label,
                    data=child_plan_node,
                )
                build_tree(tree_node=tree, plan_node=child_plan_node)
            else:
                build_tree(tree_node=tree_node, plan_node=child_plan_node)

```

#### Plan Tree Nodes

Each node in the tree provides essential information for debugging query performance:

<CaptionedImage src={planNode} alt="Screenshot of node in tree" />

- **Cardinality Estimations**: An estimate of the number of results actually generated. These are contained in square brackets `[]` - the same way Stardog displays them in query plans.
  <Callout intent="info">
    A common cause of suboptimal query plans is cardinality mis-estimations,
    i.e. when the number of results that the optimizer thought an operator would
    generate and the actual number of results are several orders of magnitude
    apart.
  </Callout>
- **Memory**: The amount of allocated managed memory used by a node/plan operator. This is only reported for [pipeline-breaking node/plan operators](https://docs.stardog.com/operating-stardog/database-administration/managing-query-performance#pipelining-and-pipeline-breakers) which materialize intermediate results in memory.
- **Intermediate Number of Results**: The number of intermediate query results generated by each node/ plan operator. The profiler detects when some part of the node/plan operator’s output is [skipped](https://docs.stardog.com/operating-stardog/database-administration/managing-query-performance#skipping-intermediate-results) over. In this case, "with gaps" is appended to the results.
- **Wall time for each plan operator** - The time spent on the server evaluating the node/plan operator. The percentage the plan operator uses of the total wall time is also displayed next to the amount of time in parentheses `()`. To provide a comprehensive view of wall time when folding section of the tree, the TUI dynamically calculates and displays the total wall time of a node's children when a parent node is folded.

Here's a snippet from the [source code](https://github.com/noahgorstein/stardog_sparql_profiler_tui/blob/main/widgets/plan_tree.py#L10C1-L20C22) showcasing the wall time calculation. This is fairly straightward to do in Python.

```python
def sum_wall_time(node: "PlanNode") -> int:
  """Utility to sum the wall time of a PlanNode's children"""
  if node.num_children == 0:
      return 0

  total_time = 0
  for child in node.children:
      child_time = child.time_ms or 0  # Consider None as 0
      total_time += child_time + sum_wall_time(node=child)

  return total_time
```

<CaptionedVideo
  src={sumChildrenWallTime}
  type="video/mp4"
  caption="Upon folding a parent node, the TUI calculates and displays the wall time of the plan node/operator's children on the parent node's label."
/>

### Color-Coded Output for Key Information

To enhance the interpretability of the query plan, I color-coded the label for each node/plan operator. By leveraging [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (also from Textualize), I applied distinct colors and styles to various elements in the tree view. This approach helps users quickly identify and understand key aspects such as memory usage, cardinality estimations, and more.

Moreover, I prepended a visual indicator (💥) to a node/plan operators label to highlight nodes that serve as [pipeline breakers](https://docs.stardog.com/operating-stardog/database-administration/managing-query-performance#pipelining-and-pipeline-breakers). Identifying these pipeline breakers is crucial for optimizing query performance, as they can have significant implications, often related to memory pressure.

<Callout intent="info"> 
From the [Stardog Docs](https://docs.stardog.com/operating-stardog/database-administration/managing-query-performance#pipelining-and-pipeline-breakers):

> Not all operators can produce output solutions as soon as they get first input solutions from their children nodes. Some need to accumulate intermediate results before sending output. Such operators are called pipeline breakers, and they are often the culprits for performance problems, typically resulting from memory pressure. It is important to be able to spot them in the plan since they can suggest either: a) a way to re-formulate the query to help the planner, or b) a way to make the query more precise by specifying extra constants where they matter.

</Callout>

### Tabs to Switch Between Query and Profiled Plan

It can be useful to view the original query you profiled with the query plan. Once again, I was able to leverage Textual's built in widgets to accomplish this. Textual has a [Tabbed Content](https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/tabbed_content/) widget which allows you switch between content panes via a row of tabs. You can actually click on the tabs to switch between tabs or use the keyboard shortcuts displayed in the footer to do so.

<video class="mb-2" controls="" autoplay="" transition:persist>
  <source src={switchTabs} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

The [footer](https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/footer/) is yet another built-in widget. It's like the control center for all your Textual bindings, neatly displaying all the bindings you've set up in your app. All you've got to do to setup bindings is utilize the ["magic" `BINDINGS` attribute](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/input/#bindings) in your Textual `App` and/or widget and define some actions for those key bindings.

```python
from textual.app import App

class ProfilerApp(App):
    CSS_PATH = "app.css"

    def __init__(
        self,
        auth: httpx.Auth,
        endpoint: str,
        database: str,
        reasoning: bool,
        query: str,
    ):
        self._auth = auth
        self._endpoint = endpoint
        self._database = database
        self._reasoning = reasoning
        self._query = query
        super().__init__()

    BINDINGS = [
        ("p", "show_tab('profiler')", "Profiler"),
        ("q", "show_tab('query')", "Query"),
    ]
...

def action_show_tab(self, tab: str) -> None:
    """Switch to a new tab."""
    self.get_child_by_type(TabbedContent).active = tab

    # this is needed to get the bindings to show correctly in footer when on profiler tab
    if tab == "profiler":
        self.get_widget_by_id("plan_node_tree").focus()
```

### Details Panels

<CaptionedImage
  src={highlightedTuiPanels}
  alt="Screenshot of sparql profiler tui highlighting overview and details panel"
  caption="The high-level profiler information panel is outlined in cyan and the plan node/operator details panel is outlined in yellow."
/>

#### High-Level Profiler Information Panel

The TUI primarily focuses on the [tree widget](#foldable-tree-like-user-interface) for navigating the query plan. However, I also added a panel that sits right above the tree widget displaying high level profiler information. This panel provides users with a concise overview of the query execution, displaying key performance metrics such as memory usage, execution time, and the number of results returned. The information is extracted from the JSON payload returned by Stardog, specifically from the `profiler` top level key.

```json {3-8}
{
  "prefixes": {...},
  "profiler": {
    "memory": "897K",
    "time": "34",
    "results": "5",
    "time unit": "ms"
  },
  "dataset": {...},
  "plan": {}
}
```

#### Plan Node Details Panel

The [foldable tree-like user interface](#foldable-tree-like-user-interface) provides a comprehensive visual representation of the entire query execution flow, showcasing detailed information about each node. However, due to its expansive nature, it may occupy a substantial amount of horizontal space.

To address this, you can utilize the Plan Node Details Panel, which offers a more focused view. This panel can be toggled to hide or show, allowing you to concentrate specifically on the details of the highlighted tree node. This proves especially beneficial when node labels extend beyond the visible area, requiring horizontal scrolling to explore the complete content of the tree.

```python
class ProfilerPanel(Widget):
    BINDINGS = [("t", "show_node_details()", "Toggle Details")]

    ...

    @on(PlanNodeTree.NodeHighlighted)
    def handle_plan_node_tree_node_highlighted(
        self, event: PlanNodeTree.NodeHighlighted[PlanNode]
    ):
        """Handles what to do each time a node in the tree is highlighted. """
        details = self.query_one(PlanNodeDetails)
        details.node = event.node.data

```

<Callout intent="info">
  I was able to just add a [message
  handler](https://textual.textualize.io/api/on/) such that when a tree node is
  highlighted (in focus) the "Node Details" panel (`PlanNodeDetails` widget) is
  updated displaying the node information.
</Callout>

## Takeaways

In tackling this project, I discovered that Textualize proved to be an excellent library for what I set out to build. Its abundance of built-in widgets simplifies the initial stages of app composition, while its flexibility allows for the relatively straightforward creation of custom widgets. While I wouldn't categorize this project as entirely production-ready, it only demanded a weekend's worth of effort to achieve useful functionality. For those well-versed in Python, averse to dealing with frontend complexities, and inclined towards constructing command-line tools, Textualize comes highly recommended from me.
